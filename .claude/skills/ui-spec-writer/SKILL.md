# ui-spec-writer

## Purpose
Convertir flujos en especificación UI independiente de herramienta.

## Course
UX-102

## Input contract
- Input: User Flows + Design System
- MUST receive a governed Context Pack or canonical source artifacts.
- MUST distinguish facts, assumptions, open questions, and human decisions.
- MUST NOT silently resolve missing business information.

## Output contract
- Output: Screen + Component + Token + AC
- Markdown outputs MUST conform to the UX/UI track conventions for Google OKF v0.2.
- New or modified concepts start with `status: draft`.
- The skill MUST set `generated.by` to its own actor/version.
- The skill MUST NOT set or fabricate `verified`.
- Open questions MUST be explicit.

## Workflow
1. Validate required inputs and provenance.
2. Extract relevant constraints and traceability links.
3. Generate candidate output(s).
4. Critique against UX requirements, acceptance criteria, accessibility, and Design System where applicable.
5. Produce draft OKF concepts and a concise change summary.
6. Stop for human review when a decision, ambiguity, or conflict requires judgment.

## Guardrails
- Never treat generated UI as approved merely because it renders.
- Never invent user research, business rules, accessibility evidence, or approvals.
- Preserve lineage to upstream US/UXR/FLW/SCR/CMP/AC concepts.
- Prefer semantic design tokens over raw visual values.
- External-tool exports are references, not the canonical knowledge artifact.

## Quality checks
- Required sources exist.
- Traceability links are resolvable.
- No critical open question is hidden.
- Output is reproducible from recorded context.
- Human verification remains pending unless supplied by a human workflow.

## Definition of Done
The skill output is ready for human review, is traceable to its sources, and can be added to the UX/UI OKF bundle without losing provenance.
