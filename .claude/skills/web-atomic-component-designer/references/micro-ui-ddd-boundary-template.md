# MicroUI DDD Boundary Analysis

## Candidate identity

- Candidate ID:
- Name:
- Proposed decision: `MICROUI_CANDIDATE` | `FRONTEND_MODULE` | `COMPOSITE_JOURNEY`
- DTC-104 page or journey:
- Primary actor:
- Business capability:
- Bounded context:
- Related subdomain: core | supporting | generic

## Four-dimension assessment

| Dimension | Evidence | Score 0 to 2 | Finding |
|---|---|---:|---|
| Domain boundary | Language, rules, ownership and context map | | |
| User journey | Coherent task, actor and outcome | | |
| Team ownership | Accountable team and decision authority | | |
| Deployment autonomy | Independent test, release and rollback potential | | |

Interpretation:

- `MICROUI_CANDIDATE`: normally 7–8, no critical contradiction and integration cost justified.
- `FRONTEND_MODULE`: normally 4–6 or strong reuse/UX reasons to remain in one Angular application.
- `COMPOSITE_JOURNEY`: contexts are individually valid but the user outcome intentionally crosses them.
- `BLOCKED`: critical security, ownership, context or integration evidence is missing.

## Context map

- Upstream context:
- Downstream context:
- Partnership or customer supplier relationship:
- Published language or contract:
- Anti-corruption layer or adapter:
- Events and consistency expectations:
- Data that must not cross the boundary:

## User experience boundary

- Entry route:
- Main task:
- Completion criteria:
- Loading, empty, error, offline and recovery states:
- Cross-context steps:
- Navigation and back behavior:
- Shared Shell responsibilities:

## Integration and operations

- API/BFF contract:
- Authentication and authorization:
- Runtime composition mechanism:
- Shared dependencies:
- Performance budget:
- Observability signals:
- Failure isolation and fallback:
- Independent release and rollback:

## Decision and consequences

- Decision rationale:
- Benefits:
- Costs:
- Alternatives considered:
- What remains inside the Angular host:
- What becomes a reusable NPM component:
- Open questions and owner:

## Traceability and review

- User Stories:
- ASRs:
- ADRs:
- Context Map:
- Component catalog:
- Technical design review:
- QA scenarios:
- Named human review event: not set by agents
